## 👩‍💻 About the project

This project is a website dedicated to selling bicycles, complemented by a blog and a contact form for a complete user experience.

Although it looks like a simple implementation with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this site has a significant advantage: it is fully manageable through WordPress, one of the most popular and powerful Content Management System (CMS) available.

A CMS is designed to make life easier for you and your customers. Because it allows you to easily manage the content of your website through an interface that anyone can learn.

This project uses WordPress advanced features, such as advanced custom fields and custom post types, to offer an even more personalized and adaptable experience.
